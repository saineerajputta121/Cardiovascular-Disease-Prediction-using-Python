# 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Prediction (Python Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project I had  analyzed  cardiovascular disease data using Python. The main goal is to clean the data, explore relationships between variables,and use a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have cardiovascular disease (CVD).

## 🧾 Objective

- Load the dataset into Python
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Understand the relationship between categorical and numerical variables with the target (CVD)
- Use correlation analysis to find important features
- Apply logistic regression to predict CVD
- Evaluate the model accuracy

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `age`
- `sex`
- `cp` – chest pain type
- `trestbps` – resting blood pressure
- `chol` – cholesterol level
- `fbs` – fasting blood sugar
- `restecg` – resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach` – maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang` – exercise-induced angina
- `oldpeak` – ST depression
- `slope` – slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca` – number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- `thal` – thalassemia
- `target` – 1 = CVD present, 0 = no CVD
